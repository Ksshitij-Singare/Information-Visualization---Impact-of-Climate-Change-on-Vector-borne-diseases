### What are Vector-Borne Diseases?

Vector-borne diseases are illnesses caused by the transmission of infectious agents—such as parasites, viruses, and bacteria—from an infected animal to a human or another animal. This transmission typically occurs through the bite, sting, or contact with the faeces or saliva of a vector, usually an arthropod like a mosquito, tick, flea, or fly.

#### Characteristics of Vector-Borne Diseases:
- Vectors ingest disease-producing microorganisms during a blood meal from an infected host and later transmit them into a new host after the pathogen has replicated.
- Once a vector becomes infectious, it can transmit the pathogen for the rest of its life during each subsequent bite or blood meal.
- Vector-borne diseases can affect humans and animals, causing a range of symptoms and severity.

### Dataset Considerations for Climate Change and Vector Diseases

- **Climate Variables**
- **Vector-Borne Disease Surveillance Data**
- **Climate-Sensitive Disease Datasets**
- **Earth Observation Data**
- **Model Outputs from Various Institutions**

#### Detailed Breakdown of the Above Considerations:

1. **Climate Variables:**
    - **Air Temperature:**
      - [Global Summary of the Day (GSOD)](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/u-s-daily-climate-normals-1981-2010)
    - **Relative Humidity:**
      - Combine maps of air temperature and dew points using the formula in the referenced paper.
    - **Land Temperature:**
      - Derived from spectral radiance measurement of the MODIS instrument aboard the AQUA Satellite.
    - **Rainfall:**
      - [Hourly Precipitation Data](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/u-s-hourly-precipitation-data)
    - **Water Quality:**
      - [USGS Water Quality Data](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/usgs-water-quality-data-for-the-nation-national-water-information-system-nwis)

2. **Vector-Borne Disease Surveillance Data:**
    - Choosing specific diseases for preliminary analysis:
        - **Dengue**: Datasets available on WHO Global Health Observatory
        - **Chikungunya**
        - **Yellow Fever**
        - **Malaria**
