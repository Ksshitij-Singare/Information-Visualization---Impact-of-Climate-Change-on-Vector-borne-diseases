What is Vector-Borne diseases?
Vector-borne diseases are illnesses caused by the transmission of infectious agents, such as parasites, viruses, and bacteria, from an infected animal to a human or another animal through the bite, sting, or contact with the faeces or saliva of a vector, typically an arthropod like a mosquito, tick, flea, or fly.
Characteristics of Vector-Borne Diseases
•	Vectors ingest disease-producing microorganisms during a blood meal from an infected host and later transmit them into a new host after the pathogen has replicated.
•	Once a vector becomes infectious, it can transmit the pathogen for the rest of its life during each subsequent bite or blood meal.
•	Vector-borne diseases can affect humans and animals, causing a range of symptoms and severity.

Types of Vector-Borne diseases and their Vectors:
•	Mosquito-borne diseases:
  o	Chikungunya
  o	Dengue
  o	Lymphatic filariasis
  o	Rift Valley fever
  o	Yellow Fever
  o	Zika
•	Tick-borne diseases:
  o	Lyme disease
  o	Relapsing fever
  o	Rickettsial diseases
  o	Tick-borne encephalitis
  o	Tularaemia
•	Flea-borne diseases:
  o	Plague
  o	Tungiasis
  •	Fly-borne diseases:
  o	Sandfly fever
  o	Leishmaniasis
•	Snail-borne diseases:
  o	Schistosomiasis
•	Louse-borne diseases:
  o	Typhus
  o	Louse-borne relapsing fever

How Do climate change affects vector borne diseases:
1.	Changes in vector habitats and distribution
2.	Changes in Pathogen Dynamic
3.	Changes in Human Vector Dynamic

Dataset considerations for Climate Change and Vector Diseases
1.	Climate Variables
2.	Vector Borne Diseases Surveillance Data
3.	Climate Sensitive Disease Datasets
4.	Earth Observation Data
5.	Model Outputs from various other institutions?

Detail Breakdown of the above considerations:

1.	Climate Variables:
  a.	Air Temperature:
   i.	Global Summary of the Day (GSOD) - https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/u-s-daily-climate-normals-1981-20101
  b.	Relative Humidity:
    i.	Combine maps of air temperature and dew points using the given formula in the ref. paper
  c.	Land Temperature:
    i.	Derived from spectral radiance measurement of MODIS instrument aboard the AQUA Satellite.
  d.	Rainfall:
    i.	https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/u-s-hourly-precipitation-data2
  e.  Water Quality
    i. https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/usgs-water-quality-data-for-the-nation-national-water-information-system-nwis

3.	Vector Borne disease Surveillance Data
Choosing Specific Diseases for the preliminary analysis
  a.	Dengue
    i.	Datasets available on WHO Global Health observatory (Applies for all below)
  b.	Chikungunya
